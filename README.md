# Shopping Pathfinder Project üó∫Ô∏è

Welcome to the Shopping Pathfinder project! This project aims to provide a solution for optimal pathfinding in a shopping mall or store environment. The goal is to help shoppers find the most efficient route to visit all the desired locations while minimizing time and energy spent.

## Overview

Shopping Pathfinder utilizes tile-based algorithms to calculate the shortest path between multiple points of interest within a shopping environment. By inputting the locations the user wishes to visit, the algorithm determines the most efficient route, considering factors such as distance, store layout, and congestion.

## Features TODO

- **Efficient Pathfinding**: Utilizes tile algorithms to find the shortest path between multiple destinations.
- **Customizable Inputs**: Users can input their desired destinations or products within the shopping environment.
- **Visualization**: Provides visual representation of the optimal path on a map or graph.
- **Scalability**: Can be adapted to various shopping environments, from small stores to large malls.
- **Integration**: Can be integrated into existing shopping apps or systems.

## Installation
